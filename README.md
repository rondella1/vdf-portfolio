## READ ME

I wanted to make a portfolio that exhibits various skills -- as both a programmer and a researcher. I plan to use it as more of a multipurpose site that captures my various interests. With time, more projects will be added in an effort to display my skills in data analysis and visual design. 

## Sections 

My portfolio website is made up of 4 sections: a landing page, an About page, a Work page, and a Contact page. 

I didn't want my website to be too cluttered, so I elected to provide very brief introduction into my professional experience and interests. The Work section includes thumbnails that link out to Github placeholders (these will be made public once I move my work to a public repo).

The illustrations are AI generated and will be replaced with my own designs in due time. 

Visitors can fill out a contact form on the Contact page which is linked to my email (via emailJS).

As you can tell, I like a more pared-down approach and wanted my portfolio do embody this.
